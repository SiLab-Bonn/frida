# Radiation Imaging

# Electrons vs Photons
Particle detection

# Detector Sensors
Material (stop), Pixel Pitch, Thickness, Internal Gain, set and reset, Biasing, temporal response and resolution (or lack thereof, if integrating), energy response and resolution (or lack thereof, if avalanche)

# Readout Circuit
hybrid vs monolithic materials, pixel-parallel circuits, column/row parallel circuits, array-parallel: power, pitch pitch, 

high dynamic range: adaptive amplifier gain, scaled sensors, 

integration time
