# in a time step simulator, when an output is calculated from input, essentially every block needs to have a 'unit delay' associated with it
# the trick is to make sure that the step is so small, relative to the dynamics of the system, that the regadless of if the block has 'phase delay' or 'prop delay' or 'dynamics'
# we won't notice that fact that it actally always takes one time step to calculate the output from the input.
# This means that every block's output at time T is a function of all inputs at time 0:T, where we an impulse reponse to model the pulse, regardless of 

# This means we need to convert all signals to inpulse response, even gaussian noise.
# But we can start from the differential equation, state space, or frequency/laplace LTI model of the system.
# then we also need a graph of connections, and the order in which to 'update' each output as a funtion of it's inputs.
