# Notes

The reason the first bit of measurement in the discriminator is so high precision is that we are just using the device for tracking. Energy resolution is just a secondary feature, mainly used for calibration and characterization, with the built in injection circuit


Two parts of 

- Schematic: Topology, Sizing, Simulation, Plotting
- Layout: PDK abstraction, placement, and routing
