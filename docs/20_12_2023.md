I'm interested in detector design for 

Institut des nanosciences de paris: INSP

Atomic, molecular, and optical, and plasma physics

Physics of condensed matter and materials

Statistical/quantum mechanics, and quantum information


Is solid state physics the same as 

check under CNRS: institutes of chemistry/physics



Under sorbonne:
CSE is for solid state battery chem.
	Not for me
LCP-MR Laboratory of Physical Chemistry-Materials and Radiation:
	Had some positions doing UFspectrocopy @ SOLEIL, electronic structure of materials, pump probe techniques, laser
	https://lcpmr.cnrs.fr/
	
PMMH: wave propogation and head, etc in cells and solids, mechanical waves, Sorbonne+PSL+UPCite + CNRS
LULI: laboratory for intense lasers, mainly working with plasmas, affiliated with Polytechniue


INSP: institute of nanosciences, at Jeassu, quantum confinement, magnetism and spin, nanophotonics, energy, quantum technology
	molecular beam epitaxy, fast ion beam. One paper on label-free microscopy w/ adaptive optics, optical abberations
LPENS: Physics Laboratory @ ENS. Focuses on fluids, interfaces, biophysics, and astrophysics

LPEM: Laboratory for Physics and Material:

One statistic: In ALICE, water cooling is not needed if power consumption is < 20 mW/cm^2

Ultra-thin (20-40um) bent MAPS, with 10-25um pitch pixels.
