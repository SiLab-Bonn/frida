- Intro
- Background
    - Particle types, detectors/AFEs good for each
    - Radiation damage, detector constraints
    - ADC FOMs
- Contributions
    - FOM for pixel detectors, evaluate w/ Comparative studies of AFEs
    - FOSS tooling
        - Design phase: Schematic and layout generators (optimization vs template vs design equation based)
        - Testing phase: integration w/ 
    - Demonstration of tooling: building blocks (PLL, should go in appendix?)
    - Using AFE FOM and tooling: Propose various optimized AFEs
    - Test fabricate AFE (appendix?)
