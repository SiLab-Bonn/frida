# Liquid cell in-situ EM has low dose rate requirements

# Levin 2020, an example beam dose would be 500 e- per A^2 (1s exposure) # 300keV

# KITE, Dectris 2023 has 10^8 cts/s/pix, which corresponds to a 300 keV electron beam current of 14 pA/pix
# This was for 100um pitch pixels

# Denes TEAM 2023 mentions 1800 e− / Å^2 @ 200kEV.

# Therefore I think we can expect 2000 e- / Å^2 @ 300 kEV, o
