bjt vs mosfet

majority carriers, wi thermall my insensitive (thermal generation and recombination are not so perfect, less noise)

high input impedance, low power

Smaller, simpler fabrication

# List of junctions

This studied the electric, thermal, and quantum effects of carriers and electromagnetic fields in lattices of crystall solids. It extends beyond semiconductors, of course, as both insulators and conductors exist here too, so the label is a bit of a misnomer.

The scope is wave functions to junctions. At the top end, this is:

* mos  metal isn’t usually used thoPolysilicon gates can bear high temperatures while metal gates can melt over that same temperature, so we can use the polysilicon gates as a self-alignment gate process during the fabrication of CMOS. There’s no current flow, but the electric field can still modulate the bend across the oxide. Flat band, accumulation (e in n type), depletion (space charge), inversion (holes in N) states 

* pn

* ms junction. schottky barrier vs ohmic state. called a ohmic contact if metal work function is less than SC work function
* pin (or ptype-oxide-ntype)

One important link, after studying devices in a vacuum, is to study them under radiation from incident particles, i.e. 

$$
-\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2}=\frac{dE}{dx}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}
$$

### Device fabrication possible steps:

Dy processing/microstructuring, ceramic layer deposition, reactive ion etching, metrology, wet processing (organic-organic etc, maskless lithography, dicing (by wafer size), GEM foil production, backside processing, wafer-wafer bonding, through silicon vias, bump-bonding
