# Justification
I'm interested in working professionally in area of engineering + physics where systems of meaningful value can be manufactured by relatively small companies of people. This means systems where 1-4 sensor chips are sufficient for the experiment. So not:
large accelerators like KEK or LHC
synchrotron light sources like NSLS, PETRA II, ESRF, and APS
linear light sources like euXFEL, LCLS, or SwissFEL
or MeV electron sources like REGAE or SLAC MeV-UED


I want to work for a private company, which designs ASICs.

I'd like the company to be focused on science, in the area of radiation imagers or detectors. The primary concern here is that it needs to be close enough to my 

For commerical applications, whether it's standard CMOS image sensors, electron microscope detectors, or x-ray imagers, it seems the standard methodology is to use hybrid connection.

# Plan
Deliver ADC and PLL for DMC upgrade, in 28nm and 65nm by June 2025. They leave for company, where I continue work on the PhD, but entirely on project which the company is interested in, hopefully focusing on using my Substrate code.
 
One issue here is my Visa, and my PhD registration. Can I submit a thesis with University of Bonn, if I'm no longer even living in Germany? Also I would need to travel back to Bonn-semi regularly to share results of what I'm working on with Hans.

Go to Iworid with evidence of what I can do with Substrate in process portable Pcells, and try to find a good fit with a company.

# what do I tell the company
I want to finish my PhD, but I need more professional guidance, and my partner is moving to the city. I state I want to take a 'paycut', or work parttime, as I don't want them to think of me as being absent. So instead I would want to pitch this as an extended internship. 

# what to tell Bonn
I want to finish my PhD, but I need a real company to learn what I'm doing, on a real project with more than myself and Hans. I would need to start discussions far enough in advance, such that Hans and Jochen feel involved in this decision. I should tell them I need more professional guidance, and that my girlfriend is moving and I want to follow her.


# Comparison of companies

Let's looks through the sponsors of [IWORID2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1120714/page/25141-sponsors) and [IWORID2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1247911/) to find companies which might be a good fit for me to find mentorship and money, which still being close enough to finish my phd work. Also look at [Medipix companies.](https://medipix.web.cern.ch/buy-medipix-and-timepix-products)

In each, look at their jobs board, search on line for "companyname + ASIC", and look through the Iworid presentations to see if they published any papers.


# Dectris, 32min from Zurich
Pilatus3 ASIC in 2012, based on the UMC 0.25um process, with guard rings and enclosed layout transistors (ELT)
IBEX and KITE asics, in 110nm UMC
UMC has a 28nm, 40nm, and 65nm foundry options which Dectris could be interested in moving too.

# questions
[Lexicon of terms](https://caeleste.be/lexicon/)

shot noise?
fano noise
landau fluctuations
dark noise/dark current
1/f noise (i.e. flicker noise)

kTC noise/thermal noise

CDS -> cancels FPN but not kTC noise
DSNU -> Dark Signal Non Uniformity, expressed in [V/s]RMS or VRMS. The spatial noise due to the pixel-to-pixel non-uniformity of the dark current.

ENC	(term coined in HE physics) Equivalent Noise Charge. Unit [electrons]. ENC=TN+FPN



# conferences

[IISW](https://imagesensors.org/past-workshops-library/) - International Image sensors workshop, each summer, hosted by [International Image Sensor Society](https://imagesensors.org/)

Space and Scientific CMOS Image Sensors Workshop - by ESA ESTEC
Workshop on CMOS Image Sensors for High Performance Applications - same as above?


[AMICSA](https://indico.esa.int/event/480/) - International Workshop on Analogue and Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits for Space Applications, hosted by ESA. But this very rarely has anything for CMOS image sensors.

Forza Silicon/Ametek
Teledyne e2v: III-V or II-VI semiconductor MBE growth and characterization of semiconductor materials. MBE is also good for band structure engineering and passivation of silicon-based photodectors. Not it can be done on a wafer scale. An alternative is atomic layer deposition (ALD)

Global shutter, rolling shutter, CTIA, dual gain, LOFIC

mixed-signal/mixed-mode simulations, Verilog-a/ams, Verilog, Wreal modelling, 

low-level interfacing protocols such as MIPI-CSI2, USB, GIG-E, SLVS.

[LOFIC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9281334) - Lateral Overflow Integration Capacitor

[Gpixel](https://www.gpixel.com/en/about.html#d1) - has design offices in Antwerp, BE. Decended from CMOSIS/Fillfactory, like Caeleste.
