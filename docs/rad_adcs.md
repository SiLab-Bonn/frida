Particle detector for tracking are weird, as they don't form images, are single particle sensitive, and they don't really measure 



AGIPD:
Hybrid system w/ bump bonds, 200um pitch, 

4.5 MHz (pulse separation of by 220 ns) for up to 2,700 pulses (total train 600 Âµs)
10Hz repetition (10ms), so there is 99.4 ms of spacing after start of new train

Stuff at linear accelerators
Stuff at syncrotron light sources



Are cyclic ADCs used in all of these?


Not considered (as they are trackers)
OBELIX monolithic (BELLE II)
ALPIDE (ALICE)
RD53 (CMS + ATLAS HL-LHC)
FE-I4 (ATLAS LHC)
