Aligning my understanding of 'human in the loop' systems, with and understanding of why a totally human-less trust free crypto system is not great. We want our systems to move at the speed of humans. Mandating human-in-the-loop design can prevent computer speed instabilities. Before banking, coinage/cash was a 'trust' free system, which stabalished itself based on the difficulty in counterfitting. With modern technology though, counterfitting coins and bills is becomming increasingly easy, so it doesn't seem we could go back to this system.

those that engineer systems, they traditional engineers, policy makers, farmers, and all manner of civil servants  key responsibility society which people are able to live happy fulfilled, lives between the lower constraint of the state of nature, and the upper Street of the emotional, psychological, environmental, sociological, and cultural constraints and diversity constitution.


A large portion of this is the purvey of engineers, who use fundamental discovers in physics to produce technology that measurably changes the way we live our lives. 


Therefore, it is the responsibility of this variety of engineers to always question whether or not a new creation, helps community, live more balance, life, or if simply causes us to spiral off into a delicate and complex engineered world with high cost and low resilience.


In particular, the design of integrated electronic circuits is a delicate and complicated undertaking, with high expenses.


however, it’s likely that the large majority of integrated circuits, both buy variety and quantity, engineered for built into systems overall balancing well-being of humans.


The solution to the problem caused by problems, centralized, controlling industrial, and capitalistic technologies It’s not to create increasingly technologies, that are even more automated cut out centralized people. the solution is to simplify technology by adding more people into the system and its management. extremely high complexity systems are never truly distributed, because a few people understand them, and those individuals can influence many people.
