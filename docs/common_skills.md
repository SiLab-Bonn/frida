# Summary of SKILL, Ocean, MDL, CDL, etc

- CDL is just a subset of SPICE netlists, primarily used during LVS. It's generated by CDLout.
- OCEAN is tied to Virtuoso ADE, so requires the Cadence runtime. But it also works with any underlying simulator, not just Spectre. It's essentially just a library of SKILL. And it has the addition of OCEANXL for ADE Assembler.
- MDL is run within the simulator - as such, this means that it's well-suited for a command-line Spectre user as the approach is quite Spectre-like and doesn't need you to use a larger executable such as Virtuoso to control/post-process your results
- MDL can also be used to make measurements during simulation, and auto-stop when they've been met - so for characterisation tasks (such as setup/hold) this can be more efficient
- MDL also gives access to some simple search and multi-variable optimisation within the simulator - so whilst not as powerful as the optimisers in ADE, it's much faster
- MDL is however quite limited in the functions available, and doesn't really handle things like RF analyses.
- OCEAN is more extendable, but is very much a means of controlling whole simulations and analysing the results from whole simulations. Because OCEAN is just a set of SKILL functions, the language has not been designed specifically with simulation in mind and so it can appear a little clunky compared with MDL which was designed specifically for the purposes of making measurements in simulation - although SKILL has the upside that comes from being a pretty broad programming language.
- OCEAN tends to be more natural for somebody used to using ADE as it fits alongside ADE (it's using the ADE infrastructure underneath).
- So there are pluses and minuses of both - which is why both exist. Historically, OCEAN has been around for longer, and when MDL was first created there was a thought that it would replace OCEAN for calculations, doing measurement-centric simulation and so on - but in practice the need for legacy support and also the fact that MDL was specific to Spectre meant that didn't quite pan out. Some may remember in the past that the waveform tool at the time, wavescan, initially was for MDL, then extended to have two language modes, and finally dropped the MDL mode.


Spectre supports output files of nutbin, nutascii, psfbin, psfascii, psfbinf, psfxl, sst2, fsdb, fsdb5, wdf, uwi, and tr0ascii.

Nutbin/ascii are SPICE3 legacy formats, and PSF stands for "parameter storage format"
