Spectroscopy is frequency resolved , where microscopy is spatially resolved. Both could be temporally resolved too.

A spectrometer is any instrument that’s used to measure the variation of a physical characteristic over a given range, i.e. a spectrum. This could be a mass-to-charge ratio spectrum in a mass spectrometer, the variation of nuclear resonant frequencies in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, or the change in the absorption and emission of light with wavelength in an optical spectrometer. The mass spectrometer, NMR spectrometer and the optical spectrometer are the three most common types of spectrometers found in research labs around the world.


The concept of Bragg x-ray diffraction applies equally to neutron diffraction and approximately to electron diffraction.[4] In all these the wavelengths are comparable with inter-atomic distances (~ 150 pm) and thus are an excellent probe for this length scale. Many other types of matter waves have also been shown to diffract.

More formally, bragg-diffraction is a subset of compton in-elastic scattering

three-dimensional structural data of molecules generally containing at least carbon and hydrogen, comprising a wide range of organic, metal-organic and organometallic molecules.The data, typically obtained (99%) by X-ray crystallography and less frequently by electron diffraction or neutron diffraction.

Light matter interaction is the core of all analytic instrumentation, save those that rely of mechanical matter vibrations like sound.

On the front end, light (optical, x-ray, gamma photons) or matter (neutrons/electrons) are either the immediate object of interest, or a secondary signal either...
emitted: luminescence (cold electromagnetic radiation, including flourescnce, phosphorescnce, etc), incandescence (thermal EM radiaiton), 
refracted/diffracted/transmitted/attenutated 

Absorbtion spectroscopy

scattering

lasers are 'stimulated light radiation, which are then amplified'. 

FELs, are related to lasers, but are more tunable and more powerful. They are tunable from microwave -> X-ray (Xfel)

electron beam, either linear or circular, can be bent to get x-ray synchrotron radiation

A large fraction of experiments using synchrotron light involve probing the structure of matter from the sub-nanometer level of electronic structure to the micrometer and millimeter levels important in medical imaging. Synchrotron is one of the most expensive kinds of light source known, but it is practically the only viable luminous source of wide-band radiation in far infrared wavelength range for some applications, such as far-infrared absorption spectrometry.

Photons can interact with matter at the atomic level (e.g. photoelectric effect and Rayleigh scattering), at the nucleus, or with just an electron (Pair production and the Compton effect)

Bethe–Bloch formula governs mean energy loss of swift charged particles through matter (protons, alpha particles, atomic ions). The Bethe formula is only valid for energies high enough so that the charged atomic particle (the ion) does not carry any atomic electrons with it. At smaller energies, when the ion carries electrons, this reduces its charge effectively, and the stopping power is thus reduced. But even if the atom is fully ionized, corrections are necessary.

For electrons, despite them qualifying as charged, the energy loss is slightly different due to their small mass (requiring relativistic corrections) and their indistinguishability, and since they suffer much larger losses by Bremsstrahlung, terms must be added to account for this. 

The material is completely described by the 'mean excitation energy' I, where I = 10eV * Z, and the Z is the atomic number of the materials atoms. The Bethe formula is only valid for energies high enough so that the charged atomic particle (the ion) does not carry any atomic electrons with it. At smaller energies, when the ion carries electrons, this reduces its charge effectively, and the stopping power is thus reduced. But even if the atom is fully ionized, corrections are necessary. The most probable energy loss differs from the mean energy loss and is described by the Landau-Vavilov distribution.[3]


FEL and syncrotrons, can be used to study a wide range of application:

bright and fast X-rays are good for crystallography, protein imaging, etc

Scatting is more complicated than

Diffraction is in-elastic scatting, and is only useful for a regular crystalline samples

scattering is elastic, and is better for amorphous materials

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), is good for examining the size, shape, and suface of nano-sized features. The small angle reduces x-ray penetration to the point of almost total reflection.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods encounter problems with macromolecules of higher molecular mass (> 30–40 kDa). However, owing to the random orientation of dissolved or partially ordered molecules, the spatial averaging leads to a loss of information in SAXS compared to crystallography. 

When working with standard light imaging, feature resolution will be limited to the diffraction length (wavelength) of the light in the far-field. (in the near field, we can circumvent this). Far-field imaging techniques are most desirable for imaging objects that are large compared to the illumination wavelength but that contain fine structure. This includes nearly all biological applications in which cells span multiple wavelengths but contain structure down to molecular scales. In recent years several techniques (like STEM microscope) have shown that sub-diffraction limited imaging is possible over macroscopic distances.

The same equations apply to other wave-based sensors, such as radar and the human ear.

As opposed to light waves (i.e., photons), massive particles have a different relationship between their quantum mechanical wavelength and their energy. This relationship indicates that the effective "de Broglie" wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle. For example, an electron at an energy of 10 keV has a wavelength of 0.01 nm, allowing the electron microscope (SEM or TEM) to achieve high resolution images. Other massive particles such as helium, neon, and gallium ions have been used to produce images at resolutions beyond what can be attained with visible light. Such instruments provide nanometer scale imaging, analysis and fabrication capabilities at the expense of system complexity.

For example, visible light has a wavelength of about 4000 to 7000 ångström, which is three orders of magnitude longer than the length of typical atomic bonds and atoms themselves (about 1 to 2 Å). Therefore, a conventional optical microscope cannot resolve the spatial arrangement of atoms in a crystal.

Electrons can be focused using magnetic or (sometimes) electrostatic lenses, generically called electron optics. Focusing X-rays with conventional optical lenses can be a challenge. Scientists have had some success focusing X-rays with microscopic Fresnel zone plates made from gold and also with long, tapered capillaries that achieve critical-angle reflection.[4] Diffracted X-ray or neutron beams cannot be focused to produce images, so the sample structure must be reconstructed from the diffraction (constructive interference) pattern.

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy
TEM instruments have multiple operating modes including conventional imaging, scanning TEM imaging (STEM), diffraction, spectroscopy, and combinations of these. Even within conventional imaging, there are many fundamentally different ways that contrast is produced, called "image contrast mechanisms". Contrast can arise from position-to-position differences in the thickness or density ("mass-thickness contrast"), atomic number ("Z contrast", referring to the common abbreviation Z for atomic number), crystal structure or orientation ("crystallographic contrast" or "diffraction contrast"), the slight quantum-mechanical phase shifts that individual atoms produce in electrons that pass through them ("phase contrast"), the energy lost by electrons on passing through the sample ("spectrum imaging") and more. Each mechanism tells the user a different kind of information, depending not only on the contrast mechanism but on how the microscope is used—the settings of lenses, apertures, and detectors. What this means is that a TEM is capable of returning an extraordinary variety of nanometer- and atomic-resolution information, in ideal cases revealing not only where all the atoms are but what kinds of atoms they are and how they are bonded to each other. For this reason TEM is regarded as an essential tool for nanoscience in both biological and materials fields.

From the same above:
The de Broglie wavelength of electrons is many orders of magnitude smaller than that for light, theoretically allowing for imaging at atomic scales. (Even for electrons with a kinetic energy of just 1 electronvolt the wavelength is already as short as 1.18 nm.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg%27s_law
Bragg's law covers coherent scattering of waves from a large crystal lattice, can be user to study structures beyond the diffraction imaging limit. Such law had initially been formulated for X-rays upon crystals. However, it applies to all sorts of quantum beams, including neutron and electron waves at atomic distances if there are a large number of atoms, as well as visible light with artificial periodic microscale lattices. 

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography)
Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of beam used, as in the terms X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction and electron diffraction. These three types of radiation interact with the specimen in different ways.
- X-rays interact with the spatial distribution of electrons in the sample.
- Electrons are charged particles and therefore interact with the total charge distribution of both the atomic nuclei and the electrons of the sample.
- Neutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the strong nuclear forces, but in addition, the magnetic moment of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by magnetic fields. When neutrons are scattered from hydrogen-containing materials, they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels. However, the material can sometimes be treated to substitute deuterium for hydrogen. Because of these different forms of interaction, the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies.

From here, look at the article on x-ray, electron, and neutron diffraction. How thin do samples need to be?
