# List family (none in PYPL index)
Lisp - 1960
Common lisp - 1984
Scheme - 1975 (MIT Lisp)
Clojure - 2007 (Lisp dialect, dynamic types, in JVM)	

ML - 1973
SML - 1997
OCaml - 1996
F#... 

# Java family (PYPL: Java 2, Scala 21, Groovy 25)
Scala - 2004 (EPFL, JVM, java syntax. But multiparadigm including OOP, functional, static types, Elements of ML and Lisp)
Groovy - (JVM)

Erlang - 1986 (BEAM VM compiles Erlang to C)
Elixir - 2012 (BEAM based too)

# Miranda family (Haskell is # 27 in PYPL index)
Miranda - 1985
Haskell - 1990

Rust - Influenced by Haskell, Erlang, ML, and Lisp (via Scheme) families




Hare


error handling: global var ERRNO, doesn’t work well with multi threading

type system doesn’t help with errors

POSIX


C - bad metaprogramming (macros) and poor string processing
C++ - over complex abstractions
nim - compiles to C code
Odin
Zig - low level, few safety
Rust - low level, but has lots of abstractions. Doesn't compile to C, but depends on libC of distribution
Hare
C3
Jai
Carbon
Go - not as low level as Zig, bad interop with C as it has a runtime


protiens are like bead necklaces, which then fold up into little balls. The pockets on the surface determine behavior?

enzymes can produce molecules

https://rosettacommons.org/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold

the interop between C++ and python, especially in life times, is 

smalltalk to common lisp


XML, serilizing data, Common lisp, Implementing a lisp in my C++

it's really easy to make graphs, trees, linear sequences with LISP

there are a lot of dialects of LISP: scheme, Emacs, commonlisp, 

you can't write loops in python, and have them run quickly.

LISP is the only system where you can "speak to the machine"


# embedded languages
Tcl - embeddable but unfamiliar syntax, bad for data description
Lisp (CommonLisp, Scheme, Racket, Clojure) - unfamiliar syntax
Lua (also Fennel) - should be embeddable as a C lib
python
bash
