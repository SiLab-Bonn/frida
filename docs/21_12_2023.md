DEDs allow the 'whole back focal plane' to be captured
abberation correction was known but not achieved until 2000, which revolutionized both imaging and spectroscopy with TEM, allowing direct imaging of atomic lattice in crystals, and very thin non-crystalline materials
abberation correction also allowed increased beam current
geometric vs chromatic abberation, johnson noise -> these limit spacial resolution
k-space information can be obtained from angular-resolved scattered electrons

What is the 'back-focal plane' of a probe?

Electronic readout (in 1 dimension) first came to scanning, but even in this domain, useful information in the surrounding area of the beam exists (annular dark field and back-scattered diffraction patterns) and so we'd benefit from having 2D sensors in this area.
