## Computing
Numerical/approximate methods existed before Computer science and programming. Older methods, like analog computers/slides rules are approximate because of error accumulation from mechanical tolerances and electronic noise. And so the methods explored by them accumulate error in a different manner. Digital computers instead accumulate error through quantization. Herein lies the beauty of digital; after conversion, it suppress analog noise/error with noise margin, at the expense of quantization error. Note: Computers drastically accelerate numerical **AND** symbolic methods. Therefore, make sure you don’t confuse numerical(approximate) methods are being the exclusive or sole domain of digital computers. Humans can also do numerical and symbolic computation. (Is analog computation a third type?)


# Eulers

Sinusoids, Trigonometric Functions, Trigonometric Identities

Rational Expression: fraction of two polynomials/monomials

Exponents

Logarithms: how many times must $x$ be multiplied by itself to get $y$? i.e. $log_{x}y$

Natural Logarithm

Euler's Formula/Identity:

$$
e^{ix}=cos(x)+isin(x)
$$
For the special case of $x=\pi$:

$$
e^{i\pi}+1=0
$$


## Math
Math is the pure study of numbers, symbols, spaces, and geometries. We can apply it for the construction of models, as well as the optimization of systems described and explained by those models. The relevant fields are 
- calculus (vector, multivariable, sequences and series)
- differential equations (ordinary and PDEs, Fourier series is solving 2nd order ODE, basic theory of Fourier series is infinite dimensional vector spaces)
- linear algebra (vector spaces)

My primary goal in understanding math is to provide an template for reusable models, optimizations, frameworks, etc. I'm focused on applied math here.

I should delve deeply enough to understand the math I see in my electronics, devices, and physics books. The focus is on my understanding and being able to speak and think in this language.
