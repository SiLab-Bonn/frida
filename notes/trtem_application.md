This high spatial (nanometer) and temporal resolution (10e-6 to 10e-15) microscope has numerous potential applications for the study of structural and electronic phase transformations, catalytic activity in nanoparticles and nucleation and growth.[Campbell 2006](../../library_detectors/electron_detectors/2006_G_Campbell_pratical_TR_EM.pdf)


Just shortening frame time, or light exposure time doesn't work well, as noise grows. Instead use pulse electron sources [Campbell 2014](../../library_detectors/electron_detectors/2014_Campbell_time_resolved_EM_insitu.pdf)

Recording multiple frames can be done in a stroboscopic pulse train by steering the resulting electron pulses into different portions of the second on different times, using an orthogonal pair of electroscatic deflection plates. In this case, the resolution is limited by the subdivided regions, and the stabiliting time of the defletion plate power supplies.

Suffice to say, the following are in our speed range (and tolerate):

Dislocation dynamics at conventional strain-rates
nanomaterial synthesis and manipulation. Or in other terms: Nucleation and growth of things like nano-particle, and nano-tubes. These can be 'functionalized'
Dynamics of structural biology: proteins, enzymes, ligands, DNA? These can be aided by filling them with high-Z gold nano particles, to increase contrast.
Battery science: delithium anodes, charging discharging/cycling, dendrite formation, breakdown of lithium ion trasport (battery failure), microdischarge events
Other softmaterials like plastics (biological samples are considered soft)


Things like the below are too fast for us:
Phase transformations: Phase change materials (useful for optical storage, and future PC memories from Intel) use phase change
melting and resolivat
magnetics switching
