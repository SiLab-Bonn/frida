MINOS flourecense microscopy is:
20x magnification, equivalent to 0.325 micron per pixel



From images from Sascha Epp, in a 64x128 EDET testbed:
~500 nm of sample mapped across 128 pixels, so about ~4nm per pixel

In EDET, each pixel is 50um

Therefore, 4nm image section maginifed across a 50000nm pixel:
12500x magnification, with 4nm per pixel
