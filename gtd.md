[ ] LSB isn't considered, as the bit after the final DAC update isn't recorded. Three weights b2-b1-b0 on the cap array of 4-2-1 is a 4-bit design
[ ] Double conversions clearly aren't addressed right, as can be seen in the basic case of 4-2-2-1 weights. If b2 is correctly measured, b2c shouldn't negate it...
[ ] Expression for calculating re-analog should use correct expression

[ ] replace active input with passive
[ ] replace logic with Verilog-A
[ ] replace comparator with ideal
